### LakeCTF 2022 - crypto 416 - 14 solves

> After getting hacked, the *organizers* of the CTF created a **new** and more secure account. You were able to intercept this PGP encrypted e-mail. Can you decrypt it? [flag.eml](flag.eml)

#### What we have 

Our goal is to decipher encrypted PGP message. Lets first store the encrypted message at [msg.enc](msg.enc). Lots of information embedded at email header. We know that the receiver is using [protonmail](https://proton.me/mail), and receiver's name and email address: `epfl-ctf-admin2@protonmail.com`. We get receiver's public key [protonmail's public key GET api](https://mail-api.proton.me/pks/lookup?op=get&search=epfl-ctf-admin2@protonmail.com). Locate at [epfl-ctf-admin2.asc](epfl-ctf-admin2.asc).

Lets inspect [epfl-ctf-admin2.asc](epfl-ctf-admin2.asc). Feed it to this awesome tool: https://cirw.in/gpg-decoder. It shows that public key algorithm is `publicKeyAlgorithm: "RSA (Encrypt or Sign) (0x1)"`, with public modulus having bit len 4096, and `e` be `0x10001`. I notice that subkey is also included, having same security with the primary key. Also you may check key internals with below `gpg` command:

```sh
cat epfl-ctf-admin2.asc | gpg --with-colons --import-options import-show --dry-run --import 
```


#### Read the docs

According to the [docs](https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys), 

>  GnuPG actually uses a signing-only key as the primary key, and creates an encryption subkey automatically. Without a subkey for encryption, you can't have encrypted e-mails with GnuPG at all. Debian requires you to have the encryption subkey so that certain kinds of things can be e-mailed to you safely, such as the initial password for your debian.org shell account.

So we must factor subkey's public modulus to get flag. It seems not good. All the *fancy* factorization algorithm failed, and unfortunately we do not have quantum computers.

#### Guess Time 

We stare at the email address: `epfl-ctf-admin2@protonmail.com`. We stare it again and again, read the problem description several times, and guess to query [protonmail's public key GET api](https://mail-api.proton.me/pks/lookup?op=get&search=epfl-ctf-admin@protonmail.com) with `epfl-ctf-admin@protonmail.com`. (Yes number `2` had vanished). We get another public key, with equal security, and saved at [epfl-ctf-admin.asc](epfl-ctf-admin.asc). Will it help?

#### Analysis and GCD Fun

Lets get subkey's public modulus, using https://cirw.in/gpg-decoder, and take gcds. We get a nontrivial factor! Not enough entropy was given while key generation. See [factor.py](factor.py) to get actual numbers and get juicy `p`, `q`, `d`, and `u`.

#### Patch pgpy to decrypt

The hardest part of this challenge. We need to use our private numbers to decrypt. Lets patch this [pgpy](https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/PGPy) which seems to be unmaintained.

Two thing to patch:
1. Make `pgpy.PGPKey.new(PubKeyAlgorithm.RSAEncryptOrSign, 4096)` be created based on factored results: `p`, `q`, `d`, and `u`.
2. Match signature: `2461439C55F8627A`. `pgpy` will complain when newly generated key's signature and encrypted message's signature mismatches. Extract signature using https://cirw.in/gpg-decoder, and patch the library. We do all this stuff in [solve.py](solve.py).

We finally get the flag:

```
EPFL{https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/174943#Lenstra<3}
```

Which links us to this infamous paper: [`Ron was wrong, Whit is right`](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/174943#Lenstra), which again tells us public keys in the wild are not so random.
