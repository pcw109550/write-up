# Double Message Writeup

### Defenit CTF 2020 - Crypto 201 - 67 solves

> Here is output of Double.sage. Catch The Flag.

#### Analysis

The challenge setting/exploit code is almost identical on this [awesome writeup: Confidence CTF 2015 rsa1](http://mslc.ctf.su/wp/confidence-ctf-2015-rsa1-crypto-400/).

#### Coppersmith's short pad attack + Franklin-Reiter related message attack

The only part to modify from original writeup is the solution size argument for sage's `small_root()` function.

Two messages `M1`, `M2` are generated as below.

```python
M1 = Flag + md5(Flag).digest()
M2 = Flag + md5(b'One more time!' + Flag).digest()
```

To apply [Coppersmith's short pad attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack#Coppersmith.E2.80.99s_Short_Pad_Attack), knowing length of padding is necessary. Fortunately, md5 is used for padding, having length of 16 bytes or 128 bits. Give this information to `small_root()` function like below.

```python
roots = h.small_roots(X=2**128, beta=0.3)
diff = roots[0]
```

Difference of plaintexts(`diff`) is known. Apply [Franklin-Reiter related message attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack#Franklin-Reiter_Related_Message_Attack) and get flag: 

```
Defenit{QQu!_3sC4p3_FR0m_D3v1l!_n1c3_C0gN1z3!}
```
