# Dodge Writeup

### Defenit CTF 2020 - Misc 906 - 3 solves

> Dodge it! `nc dodge.ctf.defenit.kr 1357`

#### Hints

- This dodge is multi-tasking-dodge(4 tasks), get more than 120 points!
- You will get your score after the game.
- You can change the focused game with q, e and moving direction of the player with w, a, s, d.
Focused game is marked with `*` next to the number.

#### Observation

To start the game, solve 3 byte PoW. Four dodge games start with following below rules.

1. Map
    - Map with width 40, height 20.
2. Player(Marked as `p` on Map)
    - Player position randomly initialized with random velocity.
    - Player cannot move diagonally. Only `wasd`.
    - Player can only move one block at a time.
    - If no input, player keeps its velocity.
3. Bullet(Marked as `*` on Map)
    - Bullets are spawned every 3 rounds starting with 2nd round.
    - Bullets can move diagonally.
    - Bullets can be overlapped, even when they are first spawned.
    - Bullets have constant magnitude of speed.
4. Collision
    - If player/bullet collides with wall(Marked as `#`) will bounce with following [elastic collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision).
    - Each of bullets do not collide together. They just overlap.
    - If player collides with bullet, game ends.

Each rounds give single point. If I get more than 120 points(pass more than 120 rounds), I win and get flag.

#### Exploit

Let me implement heuristic algorithm to dodge. The key point is that, **most of bullets can be deterministically tracked**.

First two rounds are free. No bullet is spawned. New bullet is added every 3 rounds, starting from third round(`i = 1`). Use these rounds to track player position and velocity. I can track and verify position and velocity of bullet by the following algorithm.

1. Round `3 * i`: New bullet is spawned.
    - If new bullet is not detected, give up tracking, meaning that overlapping occured.
    - If not, store new bullet position(`y1, x1`).
2. Round `3 * i + 1`: New bullet moves.
    - If new bullet is not detected, give up tracking, meaning that overlapping occured.
    - If not, store new bullet position(`y2, x2`).
3. Now estimate new bullet's position and velocity.
    - Past two positions known, so velocity(`y2 - y1`, `x2 - x1`) known.
    - Since velocity known, future position of new bullet can be estimated.
4. Round `3 * i + 2`: Check estimated result is true.
    - Let new bullet position be (`y3, x3`).
    - Estimated position be (`y2 + (y2 - y1)`, `x2 + (x2 - x1)`)
    - If estimated result is false, It means that at `3 * i + 1`th round, bounce occurred during previous round. Therefore position/velocity was wrong. Recalculate postition/velocity by using position(`y3, x3`) and (`y2, x2`), so velocity(`y3 - y2`, `x3 - x2`)

By iterating above algorithm, I could mostly track all position the bullets. After knowing position and velocity of bullets, future positions are deteministic. Using determined future bullet positions, I could send control commands to avoid bullets. I easily bypassed over 120 rounds, and got until more than 150. Example map while dodging 148th round:
