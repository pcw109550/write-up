#### Solving ECDLP

The challenge asked us to solve EL[DLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm). All the parameters for initializing the problem was given. Base point `G`, Public key `P`, and elliptic curve parameters `a`, `b`, `p`. The only changing value was `P`. `p = 14753` so the discrete logarithm problem can be easily solved using bruteforce, or just ask sage to solve it by calling the `discrete_log` method. Using the sage script, I successfully calculated the value of `secret_scalar`, which is the solution of ECDLP.

```python
a, b = 1, -1
p = 14753
E = EllipticCurve(Zmod(p), [a, b])
G = E(1, 1)
P = E(Px, Py)
d = discrete_log(P, G, operation="+")
assert P == d * G
# d == secret_scalar
```

Simply send it back to the server and get the flag:

```
flag{use_good_params}
```
